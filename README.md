# 2D_physics_Sim
A 2D game with self-defined physics engine

The game was developed in Python, running in Processing 3. The purpose of the program is to model projectile physics as well as collision detection/resolution strategy.
The game terrain includes a flat ground, a stonehenge in the center, a canon, clouds, and floating ghosts.

The stones and clouds are image files. The movement of clouds indicates wind over the stonehenge.
The canon and ghosts are drawn with basic shapes, such as line, circle, and rectangle, provided by Processing 3.

The aiming position of the canon and firing of canonball can be controlled by keyboard. The motion of canonball is modelled using projectile physics incorporating initial velocity, barrel angle, gravity, and wind over the stonehenge. The postion of canonball is calculated with Euler Integration.
